		<p>
			My name is Todd Szakacs.  I currently live in Lake Mary, FL with my wife and 4 year old daughter.  I am originally from Lakewood, OH, which is a suburb on the west side of Cleveland.  I first moved to Central Florida in 2002 and have been living in Seminole County ever since - Longwood, Sanford, and Lake Mary.  I love hanging out with my family and friends at the pool or the beach or just at home.  I dig rock and roll music, horror movies, playing season-long as well as daily fantasy sports and enjoying life.  I don't want to one day rule the world - I just want to take care of my family and be the best person I can be.
